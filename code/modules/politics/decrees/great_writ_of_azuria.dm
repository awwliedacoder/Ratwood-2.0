In return, the nobles of The Realm shall undertake the duty of arms - to defend the Realm in their own person and with their retainers, to answer the Crown's call to war in whatsoever hour it cometh, and to render unto the throne the fealty that is owed by blood and by oath.

Yeven under the seal of the Crown, in witness of the Ten."}
